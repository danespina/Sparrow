EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY

A gray, impenetrable wall of fog. From somewhere comes the
FAINT SOUND of a LITTLE GIRL'S VOICE, singing, slow tempo,
almost under her breath.

                     YOUNG ELIZABETH (O.S.)
           Yo, ho, yo, ho, a pirate's life for me
           Yo, ho, yo, ho, it's a pirate's life
           for me...

Suddenly a massive SHIP emerges from the grey, the Winged
Victory maidenhead looming. It's a British dreadnought,
the H.M.S. Dauntless. Formidable, frightening, twenty-five
gun ports on a side, and rail guns to boot.

EXT. H.M.S. DAUNTLESS - FORECASTLE - DAY

ELIZABETH SWANN, strawberry blond hair, stands at the bow
railing, gazing at the seas, still singing --

                     ELIZABETH
           ...drink up me hearties, yo, ho...

JOSHAMEE GIBBS, who was born old, skin a dark leather,
clutches her shoulder, startling her.

                     GIBBS
               (sotto)
           Quiet, missy! Cursed pirates sail
           these waters. You want to call
           'em down on us?

Elizabeth stares wide-eyed at him.

                        NORRINGTON
           Mr. Gibbs.

NORRINGTON, a dashing young man, Royal Navy to the core,
glares sternly at Gibbs. Standing besides him is GOVERNOR
WEATHERBY SWAN, a man of obvious high station, brass
buttons on his thick blue jacket. He is Elizabeth's
father.

                     NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
           That will do.

                    GIBBS
          She was singing about pirates.
          Bad luck to sing about pirates,
          with us mired in this unnatural
          fog-- mark my words.

                    NORRINGTON
          Consider them marked.   On your
          way.

                    GIBBS
          'Aye, Captain.
              (as he moves off)
          Bad luck to have a woman on board,
          too. Even a mini'ture one.

He returns to his deck-swabbing duties, surreptitiously
takes a quick swig from flask.

                    ELIZABETH
          I think it would be rather
          exciting to meet a pirate.

                    NORRINGTON
          Think again, Miss Swan.   Vile and
          dissolute creatures, the  lot of
          them. I intend to see to   it that
          any man who sails under a  pirate
          flag, or wears a pirates  brand,
          gets what he deserves: a  short
          drop and a sudden stop.

Elizabeth doesn't know what 'a short drop and a sudden
stop' means. Gibbs helpfully mimes: a man being hung.

                    SWAN
          Captain Norrington... I appreciate
          your fervor, but I am concerned about
          the effect this subject will have on
          my daughter.

                    NORRINGTON
          My apologies, Governor.

                    ELIZABETH
          Actually, I find it all fascinating.

                    SWAN

          And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth,
          dear... we will be landing in Port
          Royal very soon, and beginning our new
          lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we
          comport ourselves as befits our class
          and station?

                    ELIZABETH
          Yes, father.

Chastised, she turns away, to look out over the bow rail.

                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
              (to herself)
          I still think it would be exciting
          to meet a pirate...

The fog still hems in the ship; very little of the sea is
visible --

-- but suddenly, a FIGURE comes into view. A young boy,
WILL TURNER, floating on his back in the otherwise empty
water. There is nothing to show where he came from, or how
he came to be there.

                     ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          Look!   A boy! In the water!

Norrington and Swann spot him --

                    NORRINGTON
          Man overboard!

                    ELIZABETH
          Boy overboard!

                    NORRINGTON
          Fetch a hook! Haul him out of
          there!

Quick movement and activity on the deck. Sailors use a
boathook to snag the boy he the passes. Norrington and
Swann haul him aboard, and lay him on the deck. Elizabeth
sidles in for a closer look.

                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
          He's still breathing.

                     SWAN

          Where did he come from?

                    GIBBS
          Mary mother of God ...

Attention is turned away from the boy --

The sea is no longer empty. WRECKAGE from a ship litters
the water... along with the bodies of its crew. What is
left of the ship's hull BURNS, a ragged British flag
hanging limply from the stern.

The H.M.S. Dauntless slips silently through it all.   The
scene calls for hushed voices.

                    SWAN
          What happened here?

                    NORRINGTON
          An explosion in the powder magazine.
          Merchant vessels run heavily armed.

                    GIBBS
          Lot of good it did them...
              (off Swan's look)
          Everyone's thinking it! I'm just
          saying it! Pirates!

                    SWAN
          There is no proof of that. It could
          have been an accident. Captain, these
          men were protection. If there is even
          the slightest chance one of those poor
          devils is still alive, we cannot
          abandon them!

                     NORRINGTON
          Of course not, Governor.
              (to the crew)
          Come about and strike the sails! Unlash
          the boats! Gunnery crew... jackets off
          the cannons!
              (to Swann)
          Hope for the best...prepare for
          the worst.
              (to two sailors)
          Move the boy aft. We'll need the
          deck clear.

They lift the boy. Swann pulls Elizabeth away from the
rail, away from the hideous scene in the water.

                    SWAN
          Elizabeth, I want you to accompany
          the boy. He's in your charge now.
          You'll watch over him?

Elizabeth nods gravely. Swann hurries away to help unstow
the longboat. The sailors lay the boy gently on the poop
deck, behind the wheel, then hurry off. Elizabeth kneels
down besides the boy.

His good looks are not lost on her. She reaches out,
gently brushes the blond hair from his eyes --

Suddenly, he grabs her wrist, awake now. Elizabeth is
startled, but their eyes lock. She takes his hand in hers.

                    ELIZABETH
          My name is Elizabeth Swann.

                    WILL
          Will Turner.

                    ELIZABETH
          I'm watching over you, Will.

He clutches her hands, then slips back into
unconsciousness.

His movement has opened the collar of his shirt; Elizabeth
sees he wears a chain around his neck. She tugs it free,
revealing--

A GOLD MEDALLION.   One side is blank.   She turns it over --

A SKULL gazes up at her. Vaguely Aztec in design, but to
her eyes, it means one thing only:

                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          You're a pirate.

She glances back at the crew.   Sees Norrington, giving
orders, moving toward her.

She looks back at Will -- comes to a quick decision. Takes
the medallion from around his neck. Hides it under her
coat.`;
