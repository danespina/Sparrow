# Welcome to Sparrow!

[Sparrow](http://sparrow-app.herokuapp.com/#/) is a single page online brokerage web application clone of [Robinhood](https://robinhood.com/).  Its features include user portfolios and watchlist, buying and selling of stocks, real-time stock prices, up to the minute news, and detailed company information. Stock prices and information is sourced from the IEX Group API (https://iextrading.com/) and news is sourced from News API (https://newsapi.org/).

## Technologies
Sparrow was made using a Ruby on Rails back-end that ustilizes a Postgresql database and a React/Redux front-end.

## Key Features

### User Profiles
Visitors can sign up, log in, or view a demo account from links on the landing page.  Once signed in, a user will see an interactive chart of their portfolio history above a news feed.  To the right, a container displays the user's current holdings and watched stocks.

### Holdings and Watchlist
Users can modify their holdings through buying and selling.  Forms to do so are located on the side of the asset show page.  Upon creation of a trade, validation occurs on both the front-end and back-end.
